# Overview
- Harrison Webb and Brittney Morales, CS5789 Spring 2024
- Arduino "sound art" project for Embedded Systems and Kinetic Art
- Goal of project is to create a "robot choir", where each robot sings it's own melody and they all harmonize
- Inspiration taken from the Teenage Engineering Choir (https://teenage.engineering/products/choir) and "Forty Part Motet" by Janet Cardiff
- Initially wanted to make each "singer" it's own self-contained unit and have the communicate via wifi and/or bluetooth, but ended up going with a more basic version due to time/material/project constraints
- Each arduino has it's own song part stored on a micro SD card as a .wav file and there is a main "orchestrator" arduino that triggers the other singers to begin
